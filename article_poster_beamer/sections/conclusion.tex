\section{Conclusion}

We have developed a method that is capable of inferring average causal effects without the need to specify valid control variables, when the data-generating process can be described by a linear \scm. The methodology is based on characterizing \DAG{}-structures, which involve combinatorial constraints, using a continuously differentiable constraint. By considering a class of almost-\DAG{} matrices, we derive an asymptotically valid confidence interval building on a theory of equality-constrained M-estimation. The theoretical results were further corroborated in numerical studies with synthetic data.

Further research includes developing numerical search methods that are better tailored to approximate the constrained M-estimator upon which the confidence interval is based. Another research direction is the study of the properties of \eqref{eq:def:semcoefftrue} when $\dagTolerance \in ( 0 , \dagToleranceMax)$.
